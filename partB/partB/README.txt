 Note: I used Recursive Traversing in Part B, see and run Part A for Non-Recursive Traversing!

 See RANDOM_RECORD_LIST_CREATED_IN_JAN_14.txt for my last successful random record list!
 

 ->Student ID is not 5 digit, but 10 digit! Donot try to enter more than 10 digits while searching!

 Performance Comparison

 Process -> LinkedList Result : BTree Result 
 -------------------------------------------

 Creation with 10000 random students ->  27896 ms : 1980 ms // BTree is much more faster

 Search Particular Student           ->      8 ms :    7 ms // BTree is neglibly faster
