 Cmpe160 Project 3 
 Written in VC++ 2010 Xpress Ed.
 PART A

 This project is a modification of project2, see online description for further info at

 Note: I used Non-Recursive Traversing for printing in Part A, see and run Part B for Recursive Traversing!
 But also recursive method is commented under traverseANDprint function.

 Search command is working! So you can use it!

 Contrary to project 2, for this project we only keep a list sorted wrt ID.

 Actually, I'm not expecting any stack overflow even if we use recursive version of printing! Because VC++ compiler
 optimize recursion process(learnt in MSDN forums); but we have to test project in g++,too.
